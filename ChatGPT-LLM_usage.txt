ChatGPT/LLM usage

I used chatGPt to rewrite functions, to get nicer comments through code and to get nice print statements
Next thing were i used it, is for audio conversion logic, since i didn't work with this kind of data till yet.
Also, it helped me with chaning code due to some dependencies (swtiched to different package because of some problems with installation).

Validation:
- tested, run locally, went through logic of code and debug it, try with error cases, verify output
